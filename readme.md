### Vowels and Non-Vowels
Write a program where user inputs a string. The program should identify the vowels in the string (a, e, i, o, u) and keep a count of those (create a counter for each). Also count how many non-vowels are there.
Print one line statement showing the count of vowels for each vowel and non-vowels.
